# Rusty Biscuit Monorepo

## Language 

- always prefer **US English (en-US)** over other English variants such as UK English (en-GB) when creating symbol names or writing documentation

## Package Area Conventions

- you can run `sniff repo package-areas` for a list of all the _package areas_ in this monorepo
    - most of the package areas consist of a library and CLI pairing though there is some variance to that pattern
- you can run `sniff repo packages` to get the full list of packages in this monorepo

## Just Runner

- we use the `just` runner extensively throughout this monorepo. 
- you will find a justfile at the root of this monorepo and a justfile in each of the _package areas_
- shared recipes for just can be found in the @just/ directory

## Git Identity and Signing

- all commits must use the author `Ken Snyder <ken@ken.net>` and must be
  OpenPGP-signed
- the current host is expected to have the correct signing keys available; a
  signing failure is an environment or configuration problem and must not be
  bypassed with `--no-gpg-sign`
- commit messages must not include agent attribution, co-authorship, or
  co-signing trailers such as `Co-authored-by`, `Generated-by`, or similar
  agent-identifying metadata
- repository-local Git configuration should set `user.name`, `user.email`,
  `user.signingkey`, and `commit.gpgsign`; verify these values before committing
- verify every new commit with `git verify-commit HEAD` before reporting success

## Code Comment Quality

1. **HOW-narration** — prose that restates the implementation step-by-step.
2. **Tautological examples** — assertions guaranteed by the function signature.
3. **`## Arguments` / `## Returns` blocks that duplicate field docs** — use only when adding a constraint not expressed by the type.
4. **Format-string, color, or glyph narration** — quoting literal `format!` strings, ANSI colors, or emoji codepoints in prose. They drift.
5. **Redundant accessor docs** — one-line `///` on `fn foo() -> bool { self.foo }`. Prefer `#[allow(missing_docs)]` at impl level.
6. **Section-marker `//` comments** — `// Protocol` immediately above `extra.insert("protocol", …)`.
7. **Heavy-setup doc examples** — >20-line fixtures for one assertion. Link to a real test or omit.
8. **Stale comments past their code** — comments that no longer match what the code does. Worse than no comment.

Positive criteria — comments worth their length:

- **A. Contract or invariant** not derivable from types (e.g. `atomic_write`'s `last-rename-wins` semantics).
- **B. WHY a counter-intuitive choice was made** — at the surprising line, not in the surrounding docblock.
- **C. Semantics of complex return shapes** (e.g. `extract_frontmatter_text`'s `base_line`).
- **D. Hidden coupling or external surprise** (e.g. "serialize-compatible with X", "persisted to disk").
- **E. Link to authoritative design** at module (`//!`) / module-defining-type (`///`) level only. Per-function linking is a treadmill.

**Authoring discipline.** Any edit that changes a symbol's behavior must include a pass over its `///`/`//!` docs and inline `//` comments. Fix or delete drifted ones in the same change. Reviewers should flag behavior-changing PRs that do not touch the relevant comments.

**Scope discipline.** Comment-only cleanup commits must contain no behavior changes. If `git diff` of the commit shows non-comment line changes (rendering, format strings, constants, glyphs), split the behavior change into a separate commit before requesting review.

- When in doubt, ask: *would deleting this comment lose information a future reader needs?* If no, delete.
- when drift between comments and code is detected, always assume the code is correct and the comment is wrong (unless instructed otherwise); take appropriate actions and communicate that this drift was detected and how it was resolved

## Drift Maintenance

Update alongside code changes:

- READMEs when public behavior changes
- `docs/dependencies.md` (and per-area `docs/dependencies.md`) when crates are added/removed
- `.claude/skills/` when architecture or workflows change
- This file when workspace layout, commands, or repo-wide conventions change

## Rules

- **Rule 1** — Think Before Coding.
    No silent assumptions. State what you're assuming. Surface trade-offs. Ask before guessing. Push back when a simpler approach exists.
- **Rule 2** — Simplicity First.
    Minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative features. No abstractions for single-use code. If a senior engineer would call it overcomplicated — simplify.
- **Rule 3** — Surgical Changes.
    Touch only what you must. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.
- **Rule 4** — Goal-Driven Execution.
    Define success criteria. Loop until verified. Don't tell Claude what steps to follow, tell it what success looks like and let it iterate.

## Features and Fixes

- each package area will have a `features` and `fixes` directory which contains specs
    - **features** tend to be larger in scope and can introduce new features
    - **fixes** are primarily focused on fixing existing functionality
- we have two lifecycle directories `_unscheduled` and `_completed` which can be found as subdirectories of features/fixes
    - features/fixes which have been identified but not scheduled (aka, lower urgency) will be found in `_unscheduled` with non-dated filename
    - features/fixes as direct subdirectories are "active" features/fixes and should always follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-{name}`
        - the files in a feature/fix can vary but almost always will be the `spec.md` file
    - when a feature/fix is completed it is moved to `_completed`

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **rusty-biscuit** (151527 symbols, 310830 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
