# Hugging Face API

## Task

Implement a client for the Hugging Face Rest API in the `schematic/definitions` package using the primitives from `schematic/define`. When the task is done you must use the `schematic/gen` package to generate the actual schema in `schematic/schema`.

- make sure tests are defined in `schematic/definitions` AND in `schematic/schema`
- we should look for the hugging face API key in the `HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY` environment variable or allow it to be passed in when called.

## Context

- you should read the README.md files in @schematic/README.md, @schematic/define/README.md, @schematic/definitions/README.md for context
- you should use the `hugging-face-api` skill
