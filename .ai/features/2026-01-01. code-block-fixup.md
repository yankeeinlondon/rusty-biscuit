# Code Block Fixup

1. code block padding

    - the code block is rendering correctly now but to give it a more airy feel we need to provide one character of padding
        - One blank row above and below the code block (with coding Theme's background color the full width of the screen)
        - One character padding on the left of the each line of code (with coding theme's background color)

2. title and language in heading row above code block

   - the code block's heading row is a reference to the row which has the title and is SUPPOSED to have the language indicated.
   - this row should be full width with no background color except:
       - on the left hand side, if a title is displayed (e.g., user has set `title=xyz`) then the string `▌${title} ` should be displayed with the code block theme's background color (only across this text string). Note the title DOES have a single space after it to continue the background color painting that one additional character.
       - on the right side, we should always have the language for the block
           - If no language was specified then we should default to `text`
           - The language takes a similar approach to the title with the format ` ${language} `; the characters in this string (including leading and trailing space) should use the code block's theme color
           - The text color for both the title (when displayed) and the language should be WHITE if the terminal is in dark mode, and BLACK if the terminal is in light mode.
           - The title text should be bold faced (I think it already is)

3. Complete the DSL

    - when the DSL defined in the [Code Block DSL](@shared/docs/md/code-block-dsl.md) document was implemented it appears that only the **title** feature was implemented
    - In this plan we should include both **Line Numbering** and **Line Heighlighting**.
