requirements: |
  Implement the `isolate` and `interpolate` modules in the shared library.

  Key requirements:
  - Both modules support markdown and HTML document contexts
  - Use `pulldown-cmark` and `markdown-rs` crates for markdown parsing (already in library)
  - Compare `scraper` crate vs Tree Sitter for HTML functionality
  - Phase `isolate` functions first to enable reuse in `interpolate`
  - Use relevant skills: pulldown-cmark, markdown-rs, scraper, tree-sitter

  Isolate module:
  - `md_isolate(content, scope, action)` - isolate markdown document sections
  - `html_isolate(content, scope, action)` - isolate HTML document sections
  - `IsolateAction` enum determines return type (vector vs concatenated string)

  Interpolate module:
  - Context unaware: `interpolate(find, replace)`, `interpolate_regex(find, replace)`
  - Context aware: `md_interpolate(scope, find, replace)`, `html_interpolate(scope, find, replace)`
  - `MarkdownScope` enum: Frontmatter, Prose, CodeBlock, BlockQuote, Heading, Stylized, Italicized, NonItalicized
  - `HtmlScope` enum: TagAttributes, InnerHtml, OuterHtml, Selector, Prose
  - `HtmlTag` enum: All, Body, Head, Div, Span, Section, etc.

## Plan

{ fill in when ready }


## Lessons Learned

> Capture discoveries about skills or memory resources (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.) that were inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. These insights help improve future planning sessions.


## Package Changes in Execution

> Dependencies to be added, updated, or removed during implementation. Research for ADD actions produces skill files.
