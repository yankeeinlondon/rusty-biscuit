  Implement the ElevenLabs API definition in schematic/definitions package.
  The API includes both REST and WebSocket endpoints for:
  - Text-to-Speech (HTTP and WebSocket streaming)
  - Voice management (CRUD, settings, samples)
  - Voice library (shared voices, PVC)
  - Sound effects generation
  - Core resources (models, tokens, history)
  - Workspace (usage, user, resources)
  - Service accounts and webhooks

  Reference specification: schematic/docs/elevenlabs-api.md
  Definition types: schematic/define/README.md

  ## User Clarifications (D1)
  - Scope: Full API implementation (all sections)
  - Type Strategy: Define types inline in elevenlabs/types.rs (following OpenAI pattern)
  - Multipart: Skip multipart/form-data endpoints for now (voice editing, file uploads)
  - Focus on JSON-based endpoints only
required_skills: [rust, serde, thiserror, strum]
important_skills:
  tokio: "If implementation involves async WebSocket testing or examples"
  tokio-tungstenite: "If WebSocket endpoint definitions require understanding of WebSocket protocol patterns"
  reqwest: "If implementation includes HTTP client usage examples or tests"
  schemars: "If JSON Schema generation is needed for the API types"
subagents:

## Plan

{ fill in when ready }


## Lessons Learned

> Capture discoveries about skills or memory resources (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.) that were inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. These insights help improve future planning sessions.


## Package Changes in Execution

> Dependencies to be added, updated, or removed during implementation. Research for ADD actions produces skill files.
