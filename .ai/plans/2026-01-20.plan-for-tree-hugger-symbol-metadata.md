  The tree-hugger package needs enhanced symbol metadata capture:

  1. **Symbol Metadata Enhancement**:
     - Functions need: parameters (with types), return types
     - All symbols need: associated comments/annotations

  2. **CLI Output Improvements**:
     - `--json` flag: Complete JSON output
     - Default terminal output: Colors, OSC8 links for files
     - `--plain` flag: No escape codes

  3. **Testing**:
     - Use rust-testing skill
     - Add comprehensive test coverage
     - Create fixtures for various languages

## Plan

{ fill in when ready }


## Lessons Learned

> Capture discoveries about skills or memory resources (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.) that were inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. These insights help improve future planning sessions.


## Package Changes in Execution

> Dependencies to be added, updated, or removed during implementation. Research for ADD actions produces skill files.
