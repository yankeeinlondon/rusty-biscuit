requirements:
  Implement the OpenAI Agent API (Assistants API v2) in the schematic package. This includes:
  - The Assistants API endpoints (create, list, retrieve, modify, delete assistants)
  - Thread management (create, retrieve, modify, delete threads)
  - Message management (create, list, retrieve messages)
  - Run management (create, list, retrieve, cancel, submit tool outputs)
  - Tool calling support (function definitions, parallel tool calls)
  - The full type system for requests/responses matching the API schema

  Reference: The existing OpenAI definition only covers basic model management.
  The Anthropic definition provides a good reference for implementing a full agent API.

## Plan

{ fill in when ready }


## Lessons Learned

> Capture discoveries about skills or memory resources (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.) that were inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. These insights help improve future planning sessions.

- [SKILL: example-skill]: Description of what was wrong or missing
- [FILE: CLAUDE.md]: Description of outdated or missing project guidance
- [FILE: README.md]: Description of incorrect or missing documentation

## Package Changes in Execution

> Dependencies to be added, updated, or removed during implementation. Research for ADD actions produces skill files.

<!-- For monorepos, use [ACTION(module-name)]; for single-package repos, use [ACTION] -->

- [ADD]: {package} in {pkg-mgr} - {brief reason}
    - "{research question 1}"
    - "{research question 2}"
- [UPDATE]: {package} in {pkg-mgr} - {reason for update}
- [REMOVE]: {package} in {pkg-mgr} - {reason for removal}
- [DO_NOT_ADD]: {package} in {pkg-mgr} - {reviewer rationale}
