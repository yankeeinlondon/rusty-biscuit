  The biscuit-speaks library uses some TTS solutions which require a secondary piece of software
  on the host machine to play an audio file. This is handled internally but would be better done
  via the playa library package whose responsibility it is to identify the software and then play
  audio through it. Create a plan to move the biscuit-speaks implementation to using the Playa
  library for situations where an audio player is needed. Also make sure that "speed" and "volume"
  information captured in biscuit-speaks is transferred over to the playa library.
