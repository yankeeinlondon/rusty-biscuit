//! Level 2 (`terminal-tests`) integration tests for `claudine-gen`, one test binary per
//! execution contract (`2026-09-21-consolidated-test-binaries`).
//!
//! Each module was its own test target before the consolidation and keeps
//! that target's name, which is the first segment of every test path here.
//! `Cargo.toml` sets `autotests = false`, so a file in this directory that is
//! not declared below never compiles; `test_layout.rs` rejects one.
