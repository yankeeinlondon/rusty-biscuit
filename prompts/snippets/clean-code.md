## General Principles

- Code must be **simple, direct, and expressive**.
- Always prioritize **readability and maintainability** over brevity.
- Avoid duplication and ensure all code passes tests.
- Each file, class, and function should have **one clear purpose**.

## Naming

- Use **intention-revealing, descriptive names**.
- Avoid abbreviations and misleading terms.
- Use **nouns for classes**, **verbs for functions**, **clear terms for variables**.
- Maintain **consistent naming conventions** across files.

## Functions

- Functions must be **small** and **do one thing**.
- Use **clear, descriptive names**.
- Prefer **≤ 2 parameters** (max 3).
- Avoid side effects.
- Keep a **single level of abstraction** within each function.
- Functions must **either perform an action or return data**, never both.

## Comments

- Use comments **only when code cannot express intent clearly**.
- Good comments: legal notes, rationale, TODOs, warnings.
- Bad comments: redundant, outdated, or restating what code already shows.
- Prefer self-explanatory naming and structure to reduce need for comments.

## Formatting

- Structure code like **well-written prose**.
- Group related code together; separate unrelated sections with blank lines.
- Maintain consistent **indentation and spacing**.
- Limit vertical length of functions and classes for clarity.

## Objects & Data Structures

- Encapsulate data — never expose internal structures directly.
- Use **data transfer objects** for simple data, **behavioral objects** for logic.
- Avoid `if` or `switch` statements on type; use **polymorphism**.
- Favor **composition over inheritance**.

## Error Handling

- Use **exceptions** instead of error codes.
- Don’t return or accept `null` — prefer safe defaults or option types.
- Keep **error-handling separate from main logic**.
- Always clean up resources after exceptions.

## Boundaries

- Wrap external APIs or libraries in adapter layers.
- Isolate third-party dependencies to protect against change.
- Write **tests** that capture your expectations for external systems.

## Testing
Follow the **FIRST** principles:

- Fast
- Independent
- Repeatable
- Self-validating
- Timely

Tests must be **clean, readable, and reflect real behavior**.
Never skip tests. Treat test code with the same care as production code.

## Classes

- Each class should have **a single responsibility** (SRP).
- Small and focused: one reason to change.
- Hide implementation details behind clear interfaces.
- Minimize dependencies and coupling.

## Systems

- Keep systems **modular, decoupled, and testable**.
- Use **dependency injection** to manage dependencies.
- Separate **construction** from **usage**.
- Design for **scalability and clarity**.

## Emergent Design
A clean system exhibits these traits:

1. Runs all tests.
2. Contains no duplication.
3. Expresses clear intent.
4. Minimizes the number of classes and methods.

## Code Smells (Avoid These)

- Long functions or classes.
- Duplicated code.
- Inconsistent naming.
- Magic numbers or strings.
- Overly commented or confusing code.
- Tight coupling and unclear abstractions.
- Large parameter lists.

## Clean Coder Mindset

- Treat code as **craftsmanship**, not output.
- **Refactor continually**; leave code cleaner than you found it.
- Strive for **clarity, simplicity, and correctness**.
- Generate code that another engineer can read and understand **instantly**.
